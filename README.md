# beamerticle: Convenient mode selection in Beamer documents

This class is a wrapper around the `beamer` class to make it easier to use the
same document to generate the different forms of the presentation: the slides
themselves, an abbreviated slide set for transparencies or online reference,
an n-up handout version, but most significantly a transcript or set of notes
using the `article` class.

## Installation

### Dependencies

TBC

### Automated way

A makefile is provided which you can use with the Make utility:

  * Running `make` generates the derived files
  * Running `make inst` installs the files in the user's TeX tree.
  * Running `make install` installs the files in the local TeX tree.
